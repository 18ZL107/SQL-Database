# Overview
These projects are all centered around harnessing the power of SQL databases and queries to extract valuable and meaningful insights. By leveraging SQL, we aim to efficiently access, manipulate, and analyze data, enabling us to uncover pertinent information that drives informed decision-making and empowers data-driven solutions.

## Project 1: Covid Vaccination Information
### Introduction
The database contains comprehensive information pertaining to patients, clinics, doctors, nurses, and vaccination records. The associated website offers various functionalities, such as retrieving patient information through the identification of unique patient IDs, displaying available vaccinations at each clinic, and presenting employment details for specific clinics. It's important to note that the database used in this project exclusively consists of mock data, ensuring that no real personal information is involved, and it is intended solely for educational purposes within a school context.
